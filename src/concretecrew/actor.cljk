  "ConcreteCrewActor — the ISCO-08 7114 concrete placers, concrete
  finishers and related workers job-site scheduling/logistics
  coordination actor as a `langgraph.graph/state-graph`
  (ADR-2607121000 / CLAUDE.md Actors section). One graph run = one
  coordination operation request (intake → advise → govern → decide →
  commit/hold, with a human-approval interrupt for escalated
  proposals). No infinite internal loop; checkpointed per superstep
  so an interrupted run can resume after human sign-off. Modeled on
  cloud-itonami-isco-3313's accountingsupport.actor and
  cloud-itonami-isco-7115's carpentry.actor.

                                             +-> :request-approval   (:escalate? true, interrupt-before)

  ```

  The unconditional invariant: the ConcreteCrewAdvisor can never
  directly commit a coordination record the ConcreteCrewGovernor
  refuses — every commit-record! call is gated behind `:decide`. This
  actor coordinates JOB-SITE SCHEDULING/LOGISTICS ONLY — it never
  performs concrete work itself, and the governor makes it
  structurally impossible for any proposal to finalize a
  concrete-pour/finishing-execution decision or override a
  site-safety officer's judgment (closed op-allowlist + scope
  exclusion, both hard/permanent, in `concretecrew.governor`)."
